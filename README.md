For almost the last 9 years, I have been working in a sports store chain as an administrator. When I found out about the profession of a testing engineer, I immediately decided to radically change my life.  
I just completed courses at the Hexlet Programming School with a degree in QA Engineering. So now **I am looking for an internship/job** for a vacancy **Junior QA Engineer** as I have a crazy desire to put all my knowledge into practice and thereby help a company create the best software by using my ***hard skills***: 
* Test design, testing pyramid
* Knowledge of the software development process and software lifecycle
* Testing tools: DevTools, Postman, Swagger, Trello, case.io
* Knowledge of operating systems, the ability to use Linux
* The concept of methodology Agile (Scrum, Kanban)
* Knowledge of networks, tcp/ip, http
* basic knowledge of SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
